### My Infrastructure IaC

...Managed with NixOS :snowflake:&nbsp; and chezmoi :robot:&nbsp;

</div>

## :book:&nbsp; Overview

This repository contains my machine configurations in Infrastructure as Code style.
This is possible thanks to combination of [NixOS modules](https://nixos.wiki/NixOS_modules), [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/), and [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

This repo is a [Nix Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) that you can import and use yourself but I don't recommend doing that.
You should take it as an inspiration for your infrastructure instead.

Please note that this is a Work In Progress, so stuffs may change without further notice and this README can get outdated.
My goal is to have everything as reproducible as possible.

For NixOS machines, everything is managed by NixOS modules and `home-manager`.
As for non NixOS machines, I use combination of `home-manager` and `chezmoi`.
I use `chezmoi` mainly to configure the system using [chezmoi scripts](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/use-scripts-to-perform-actions/) while `home-manager` to configure applications in the userspace.

## :package:&nbsp; Modules

- [Flake Parts](https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts) to manage `flakes` outputs.
- [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to manage my home directory.
- [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) is used to encrypt/decrypt my secrets safely.
- [Disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko) to declaratively manage disks.
- [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) for packages not available in the official NixOS repository.
- [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) to create reproducible Neovim package.

## :open_file_folder:&nbsp; Directory structure

The structure of this repository is highly opinionated.
I shamelessly took the pieces I believe is the best from people and modified it.

- [./flake.nix](./flake.nix) is the entrypoint for `nixos-rebuild` and `home-manager` commands.
- [./flake.lock](./flake.lock) is the lock file for this flake, updated daily by [budimanjojo-bot](https://github.com/apps/budimanjojo-bot) powered by [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate).
- [./flakeLib.nix](./flakeLib.nix) is where I put helper functions used in `flake.nix` file, this is where the magic happens.
- [./lib](./lib) is where I put helper functions used in NixOS and `home-manager` modules.
- [./packages](./packages) is where I put my own packages, updated daily by [budimanjojo-bot](https://github.com/apps/budimanjojo-bot) powered by [nvfetcher](https://github.com/berberman/nvfetcher).
- [./overlays](./overlays) contains overlays for packages used in NixOS and `home-manager` modules.
- [./shell.nix](./shell.nix) accessible via `nix develop` to have tools needed available in current shell.
- [./system](./system) contains my own NixOS modules and per machine system configurations.
- [./home](./home) contains my own `home-manager` modules and per user configurations.
- [./chezmoi](./chezmoi) contains files used by `chezmoi`.

## :inbox_tray:&nbsp; How do I bootstrap a new machine

### NixOS

- Clone this repository in a directory inside the machine.
- Edit `./flake.nix` file and add the new machine specs inside `outputs.flake.nixosConfigurations` schema.
- Create `./system/hosts/<hostname>/default.nix` for the new machine and configure it.
- Create `./home/budiman/hosts/<hostname>.nix` for the new machine and configure it.
- Run `git add .` then `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<hostname>` and I'm done.

### Non NixOS

- Install Nix and enable Flake.
- Edit `./flake.nix` file and add the new machine specs inside `outputs.flake.homeConfigurations` schema.
- Create `./home/budiman/hosts/<hostname>.nix` for the new machine and configure it.
- Run `git add .` then `nix run nixpkgs.home-manager -c home-manager switch --flake .#budiman@<hostname>` and I'm done.

## :pencil:&nbsp; Neovim

My `neovim` setup is packaged with [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) and exposed at `legacyPackages.neovim` from this flake.
You can run it directly if you have `nix` installed and `flakes` enabled with: `nix run github:budimanjojo/nix-config#neovim`.

## :fish:&nbsp; Fish

Fish is enabled using the `home-manager` module.

On my non NixOS machines, `fish` is patched to work without system intervention and I have a `chezmoi` script that will switch the default shell for the user to `~/.nix-profile/bin/fish`.

These are the plugins I'm using:

- [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- [FZF Fish](https://github.com/patrickF1/fzf.fish)
- [Puffer Fish](https://github.com/nickeb96/puffer-fish)
- [autopair.fish](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/autopair.fish)
- [fish-abbreviation-tips](https://github.com/gazorby/fish-abbreviation-tips)

## :abcd:&nbsp; Fonts

Starship requires powerline fonts to work.
I suggest [Nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
The font in the screenshot above is using UbuntuMono Nerd Font Regular.
Unifont is also for some glyphs to work.
On non NixOS machines, `home-manager` will install these fonts automatically.

### Sway/i3/Hyprland keybindings

I use `Super` key for Sway/i3.
`hjkl` keys are mapped to `left`, `down`, `up`, `right` arrow keys.
`S` means Super key, [0-9] means number key 0 to 9.

### Neovim keybindings

The prefix key is `Space`.
You can override this using your custom `.vimrc.local` file.
`<Leader>` means you need to press prefix key first.
If they are not in the table, that means it's using the default Vim keybindings.

### Tmux keybindings

I override the default keybindings for Tmux to be more reasonable.
Prefix key is `Alt+a` for local session and `Alt+z` for nested session.
`<prefix>` means you need to press prefix key first, `<repeat>` means you don't need to press prefix key again after triggering it (I use unconventional way instead of `-r` flag so it will stay forever unless I press `Esc` key), `<copy-mode>` means you must be in copy-mode first.
The table below lists all the keybindings set.

| Keypress              | Description                                                     |

### Zellij keybindings

I'm migrating my tmux to [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/).
I mimicked my tmux configuration to work in zellij but not everything works the same.
Prefix key is `Alt+a`, I use the "switch to normal mode" in zellij to achieve this.
`<normal>` means you need to be in normal mode, `<pane>` means pane mode, and so on.
The table below lists all the keybindings set.

|        Keypress        | Description                                                |
| :--------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
|    `<locked>Alt+a`     | Swith to normal mode (act like prefix key in tmux)         |
|    `<normal>Alt+s`     | Create new horizontal split window and back to locked mode |
|    `<normal>Alt+v`     | Create new vertical split window and back to locked mode   |
|      `<normal>r`       | Switch to renametab mode                                   |
|      `<normal>h`       | Move selection to left pane                                |
|      `<normal>j`       | Move selection to pane below                               |

|    `<normal>Alt+p`     | Go to previous window                                      |
|      `<normal>c`       | Open new tab and back to locked mode                       |
|      `<normal>x`       | Close current pane and back to locked mode                 |
